                                    inferrior and i can't go freely with another feloow childs and this make some critic point in my mind for the rest of my life. after a while i began to adapt the environment and i try to make some connection but still
                                    i don't have the humer that make people bind to me.

                                    i should lern some other knoledges like programming and designing which is simple and can be done with the aid of self with out any other inflwence. i belive i lost a lot of time or just i west time unimportantly. but
